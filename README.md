# Backbase Assignment

- The application is written with Angular 7 because of libraries available for Angular 7
- I've used Matstepper for implementing steps in Do Transfer component
- On the mobile view the Do Transfer Component form is hidden with dialog window which can be called by the bottom orange button.
- Some unit tests are added `ng test`
- The project has 2 main components: 
    a. do-transaction(for making a transfer)
    b. show-transactions(for view/sort/filter of the transfers)

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.0.2.
